# Tfaily Lab metagenomics and metatranscriptomics pipelines *(in progress)*

This repository hosts the scripts that are being used in the Tfaily Lab to perform the assembly, annotation and analysis of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data.
This repository will be regularly updated as more analysis pipelines are added to it.

Most of the scripts in this repository are written to be used with the University of Arizona HPC resources. For more information on these resources please check their [User's Guide](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/User+Guide)
